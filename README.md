# LC3_Sudoku_Solver
Assembly project for the LC-3: an attempt to create a Sudoku Solver

## Contributors:
Creed Haymond, Tanner Frandsen, and Brandon Bentley. We also got bunch of great advice from rpendleton, a TA for our class. 


### Goals
We wanted to build a Sudoku Solver in assemlby with a horribly simple architecture, the [LC-3][1]. Using only very simple forms of data manipulation, such as NOT, AND, ADD, etc. it became an incredible challenge. We didn't have a ton of time, so this puzzle does not use backtracking and it is loosly built for only 4x4's. It will currently only solve really easy puzzles that don't require re-testing any numbers. Maybe someday we can build onto it and make it solve 9x9's too. That would be neat.
